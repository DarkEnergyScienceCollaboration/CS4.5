#  Identify relevant galaxy properties

Summary -- Mapping the cosmological simulations to a set of observables is a complicated process. The result
of this effort will be a document outlining the validation process and results of the validation to ensure the
mapping produces realistic distributions of galaxy properties. A specific example is to check that the
assignment of SEDs to the galaxy components produces realistic color distributions as a function of redshift.
This will require iterating with the other working groups to define the appropriate set of validation metrics.

## Key Tasks
* Key Task CS4.5.1 ( 09/16 ): Using the validation protocol and tools test input catalogs.
* Key Task CS4.5.2 ( 09/16 ): Refine input catalogs and continue validation.

### Suggested organization
Repositories are available per deliverable.  Each key task has a subdirectory.
We have a `source` directory in each key task area for any supporting
code that goes with an effort.  There will also be a `doc` directory to hold documents in markdown,
latex, or binary formats.  The idea is to version everything and give us a good way to diff things.

Each deliverable is slightly different, so these repositories should grow to support the different need.

Please feel free to use github issues on each repository to organize work.
